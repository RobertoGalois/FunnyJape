# FunnyJape
A funny jape which consists in a game with a box you have to click on. When you succeed, you win a price. By surreptitiously pressing "A" key, you will enable/disable the random placing of the box each time you hover it. So: First, you show the game to a friend and win, Second, you let your friend failing to the game and laught secretly hihihi so funny :p :p. I feel so lonely...
